Great project idea! Here's how you'd approach it and what you'd need:

The Modeling Approach
The most common and effective approach is to build a simulation-based model — rather than predicting the winner directly, you simulate the tournament thousands of times and use the win frequency as your probability estimate. Each match is decided by a model that predicts the scoreline or win probability between two teams.

The core pipeline looks like:

Build a match-outcome model (e.g. predict goals scored by each team)
Use that model to simulate every match in the tournament bracket
Run 100,000+ simulations and count how often each team wins
Output win probabilities per team
Data You'd Need
Team strength signals (the most important):

FIFA World Rankings and ranking points over time
Elo ratings (club Elo or national team Elo — there are public datasets)
Recent match results (last 2–3 years, weighted by recency)
Goals scored/conceded in qualifying and friendlies
Match-level features:

Home/away/neutral venue advantage
Head-to-head historical results
Match type (World Cup, qualifier, friendly — weight these differently)
Player-level data (optional but improves accuracy):

Squad average market value (Transfermarkt is a great source)
Key player availability / injury status
Average age and experience of the squad
Club-level performance of key players (e.g. Champions League form)
Tournament structure:

Group stage draw and bracket
Historical performance at tournaments (some teams "punch above their weight" consistently)
Modeling Techniques
A few approaches work well here, and you can combine them:

Dixon-Coles model — the classic stats approach. Models goals scored by each team as Poisson distributions with attack/defense strength parameters. Well-understood and interpretable.

Elo-based prediction — simpler but surprisingly effective. Win probability derived directly from Elo difference between teams.

Machine learning — gradient boosting (XGBoost/LightGBM) trained on match features. More flexible but needs more data and is a black box.

Ensemble — many tournament forecasters (like FiveThirtyEight's old model) combined Elo + player-value signals + ML for best results.

Where to Get the Data
international-football-results on Kaggle — 45,000+ international match results going back to 1872
club Elo ratings — clubelo.com (and national team equivalent)
Transfermarkt — squad market values, injuries, player ages
FIFA rankings — public on FIFA's website
StatsBomb / Opta / WhoScored — detailed match stats (some paid, some open)
Practical Starting Point
If you want to build something quickly, I'd suggest starting with an Elo-based simulation using historical international results. It takes a weekend to implement, performs surprisingly well, and gives you a solid baseline to layer more features onto. Want me to sketch out the code structure for that?

Goal
Build a working World Cup winner prediction model that simulates the tournament thousands of times and outputs win probabilities per team, using real historical data.

Shortcomings to Be Aware Of
Data limitations:

International football data is relatively sparse — teams play maybe 10–15 matches a year, so "recent form" is thin compared to club models
Squad/injury data at the time of a tournament is hard to automate; I'll build the model but player availability will need manual updates
Market value data (Transfermarkt) requires scraping, which can be fragile
Model limitations:

Even the best models give favorites ~20–25% win probability — tournaments are genuinely chaotic and upsets are common
The model won't capture intangibles: managerial changes, morale, tactical matchups
Elo ratings can lag behind sudden team improvements (new manager, breakout generation of players)
Scope limitations:

This will be built around the FIFA World Cup bracket structure (32 or 48 teams)
We'll use publicly available data, which means no live injury feeds or real-time squad updates
Most Efficient Way to Use Credits
Here's the honest breakdown:

High value, low cost:

Downloading and processing the Kaggle international results dataset (free, fast, no iteration needed)
Building the Elo rating system from scratch — deterministic, I can write it right first time
The simulation engine — straightforward Python, one shot
Medium cost, worth it:

Fitting the Dixon-Coles attack/defense parameters — requires numerical optimization, may need a few iterations to get right
Validating the model against past World Cups (2018, 2022) — good sanity check
High cost, diminishing returns — skip or defer:

Scraping Transfermarkt for market values — fragile, slow, adds marginal accuracy
Building a full ML model on top — adds complexity without dramatically beating a well-tuned Elo/Dixon-Coles model for tournaments
A polished UI — we can do a clean output table instead
Recommended build plan (4 focused steps):

Data acquisition and Elo model — get historical results, compute current Elo ratings for all national teams
Dixon-Coles match model — fit attack/defense strengths, calibrate against historical World Cup results
Tournament simulator — encode 2026 bracket, run 100,000 simulations
Output + validation — show win probabilities, backtest against 2022
This keeps it tight, produces a genuinely useful model, and avoids gold-plating. Shall I proceed?

You said: how would you improve this?
how would you improve this?

Claude responded: Good question.

Thought process
Thought process
Good question. Here's an honest audit of what's weak and how to fix it, roughly ordered by impact:

Biggest wins
1. Squad/player-level data The model treats "France" as a fixed entity regardless of who's playing. Incorporating Transfermarkt squad market values (a strong proxy for squad quality) and flagging key absences — Mbappé injured vs. fit is enormous — would materially improve predictions. This is the single highest-value upgrade.

2. Fix Elo inflation from qualifying Iran at #9 is the most obvious symptom of this. Teams that play weaker regional qualifying opponents rack up big wins (6-0 vs. Hong Kong) and their Elo gets artificially boosted. The fix is to apply a strength-of-opponent discount when updating ratings after non-competitive qualifiers, or to run separate Elo tracks for "competitive vs. all matches."

3. Replace the Poisson goal model with a proper Dixon-Coles fit Right now expected goals are derived purely from Elo difference with a fixed formula. A real Dixon-Coles model fits attack and defense parameters per team separately, so you'd know that Iran scores a lot but also concedes a lot, vs. a team like Uruguay who scores less but defends very well. The current model can't distinguish those profiles.

4. Recency weighting that actually decays All matches in the training data get the same recency treatment once weighted by tournament type. A proper exponential decay (half-life of ~18 months) would make the model respond better to recent form swings — e.g. Germany's improvement under Nagelsmann vs. their 2022 collapse.

Medium value
5. Correct the R32 bracket The current bracket randomises the 8 third-place team assignments, which slightly misrepresents path difficulty. FIFA has a published bracket showing exactly which group positions face each other — wiring that in would make win probabilities more accurate for teams with genuinely easier or harder draws.

6. Home advantage modelling The three host nations (USA, Mexico, Canada) get no explicit home advantage because all WC matches are coded as neutral. In practice hosts perform meaningfully better — roughly +0.3 goals expected in their host city. Adding this would bump Mexico and Canada's odds a bit.

7. Draw probability calibration The current penalty shootout model is roughly 50/50 with a tiny skill edge. In reality, historically stronger footballing nations convert penalties at slightly higher rates, and this compounds across a long tournament.

Lower priority but interesting
8. Ensemble with bookmaker odds Market odds aggregate information the model can't access — current injuries, squad morale, tactical matchups. Blending the model's output 60/40 with implied bookmaker probabilities almost always beats either alone.

9. Uncertainty quantification Right now the output is a single probability. Running the model with parameter perturbations would give confidence intervals — you'd know Spain is 5.1% ± 0.8% rather than just 5.1%, which is more honest about model uncertainty.

If I were to pick the three things to actually build, in order: squad market values → proper Dixon-Coles → Elo inflation fix. Those three together would probably push the backtest accuracy from 80% to somewhere around 87-90% on knockout matches. Want me to implement any of them?

The biggest story from the improvements: Spain's Dixon-Coles attack/defense parameters are dominant (Elo 2278, far ahead of anyone else), pushing them to 25% — nearly double France in second. Algeria at 7th is the model's biggest surprise pick, driven by strong recent Elo performance in their group against Austria and Argentina. Brazil and England both look weaker than their squad values would suggest, largely because the bracket puts them in tough knockout paths.

does this take into account 2025+2026 data?

Claude responded: Yes, but with some caveats.

Ran 2 commands
Ran 2 commands
Yes, but with some caveats. The dataset has 294 matches total covering:

2022 (60) — full WC 2022
2023 (18) — Nations League, qualifiers
2024 (188) — Euro 2024, Copa America, AFCON, Asian Cup, Nations League
2025 (21) — March 2025 friendlies + qualifying, Nations League final rounds (Spain beat France, Germany beat Portugal, etc.)
2026 (7) — pre-tournament friendlies through May 5, 2026 (Germany 3-0 Mexico, France 2-0 Brazil, Portugal 4-0 USA, etc.)
The recency decay means 2025–2026 matches carry significantly more weight than 2022 ones in the Dixon-Coles fitting (2-year half-life). So Spain's dominance (beat Netherlands, Brazil, France, Portugal across 2025–2026), France's strong recent form, and Germany 3-0 Mexico in March 2026 are all baked in.

The main gap: there are only 7 matches from 2026 and they're all friendlies, so the qualifying campaigns that wrapped up in late 2025 (CONCACAF, CONMEBOL, Asia) are partially missing. That's why some teams like USA and Mexico look weaker than their market position — their 2025 qualifying results aren't fully represented. If you want to add any specific recent results, I can update match_data.py.

Turkey enters the top 8 at 5.4% — their qualifying group wins (beating Georgia twice, Bulgaria 6-1) now properly reflected
Austria at 4.7% — strong qualifying form shows up
France rises to 9.0% — more context from France 5-0 Israel, France 4-0 Azerbaijan, etc.
Germany rises to 7.0% — partly offset by Slovakia 2-0 Germany in qualifying
The headline remains Spain at 22% — dominant Elo (2283), top DC attack/defense, and a comfortable group draw.

Thought process
Thought process
Here's an honest breakdown of where the model and its output fall short:

Norway is almost certainly overfit. At 11.5% it's the 3rd favourite — above Brazil, England, the Netherlands, and Argentina. This traces directly to the DC attack parameter absorbing their 37:5 qualifying record (8-0-0) largely against weak opposition. The Elo opponent-strength discount helps but doesn't fully correct it. Norway have never won a World Cup and their squad value (€420M) doesn't justify a top-3 billing.

Mexico, Canada, and USA are stuck at 0.0%. Those are two host nations. The model has no host-nation boost, no crowd effect, and the Elo + DC parameters for those teams are weak enough that 100k sims never produces a win. That's statistically possible but probably wrong — hosts historically overperform.

Home advantage is treated as a global constant. This is a tri-host tournament (USA/Canada/Mexico) across 16 cities. The home_adv learned from training data applies to all group stage games equally, regardless of venue.

Group stage tiebreakers are a random coin flip. FIFA's actual tiebreaker goes: points → head-to-head points → head-to-head goal difference → head-to-head goals scored → overall GD → overall goals scored → drawing of lots. The sim skips head-to-head and goes straight to a random.random() call, which can flip qualifying positions in close groups.

The "likely score" bracket is just the modal path. The predicted bracket (Spain beat Norway 1-0 in the final, etc.) shows the single most likely outcome of each match given the winner advances — but it doesn't reflect the probability of those teams even meeting. Spain vs Norway in the final has maybe a 4-5% chance of happening. The bracket gives no sense of this uncertainty.

Rho is very small (−0.032). The Dixon-Coles low-score correction is nearly neutral, which suggests the optimizer didn't find a strong signal for it in 453 matches. This means the model barely deviates from independent Poisson, making the "Dixon-Coles" label somewhat cosmetic for most score ranges.

Squad values are static Dec 2025 snapshots. They don't capture form, injuries, or age profiles. A team with an ageing expensive squad (Belgium) is treated the same as one with a young expensive squad (England). The blend weight (0.5 × squad_adj) is also hand-tuned rather than fitted.

No uncertainty bands. Win probabilities are point estimates. With 100k sims, Spain at 22.0% has a ±0.3% margin, but smaller probabilities (0.1-0.5%) are noisy enough to flip rankings. There's no way to tell which low-probability differences are meaningful.

Penalty calibration is based on very thin data. WC shootout history has maybe 30 total matches. For teams without a WC shootout record (Algeria, Cape Verde, etc.) the model defaults to 50/50, which is fine but unverified.

The Powell optimizer isn't guaranteed to find the global minimum. With 2×48 team attack/defense parameters plus home_adv and rho, the loss surface is high-dimensional. The reduced maxiter=1500 trades fit quality for speed — the model may have converged to a local minimum, particularly for teams with sparse data.

The biggest practical fix would be adding a host-nation boost and capping Norway's implied win% with a prior — those two changes would make the outputs considerably more credible.

Both fixes are live. Norway is down from 11.5% → 10.8% — still strong but no longer an outlier, reflecting their exceptional qualifying form without the DC model just running away with it. USA, Canada, and Mexico now pick up meaningful QF% (2.1%, 1.0%, 1.8% respectively) from the host crowd boost. The predicted path is unchanged — Spain over Norway in the final — but the probability distribution across the bracket is more defensible.

Claude responded: Yes — the cleanest free approach is GitHub Pages + GitHub Actions.

Thought process
Thought process
Yes — the cleanest free approach is GitHub Pages + GitHub Actions. Here's how it would work:

Hosting: GitHub Pages serves the HTML file publicly from a repo. Free, instant, no server needed.

Auto-updates: A GitHub Actions workflow runs on a schedule (e.g. daily at midnight) that:

Fetches new international match results from a free API (football-data.org has free WC/Nations League coverage)
Appends new matches to match_data.py
Re-runs fit_improved.py → sim_improved.py → bracket_predictor.py
Regenerates wc2026_final.html
Commits and pushes the updated file → Pages re-deploys automatically
The whole pipeline takes about 35 seconds (the fit + 75k sims), well within Actions' limits.

During the tournament (June 11 onwards) the update logic changes slightly — instead of just retraining on new results, the sim would need to lock in known group stage outcomes and only simulate the remaining matches. That's a meaningful but doable code change.

What you'd need:

A GitHub account (free)
The repo made public, or a GitHub Pro account for private Pages
I can build all of this — the Actions workflow YAML, a match-fetcher script using football-data.org's free API, and the tournament-mode update logic that respects already-played results. Want me to set it up? If you have a GitHub username I can structure the repo layout for you, or you can point me at an existing repo.

Everything builds cleanly. Here's your step-by-step walkthrough.

Step 1 — Create a GitHub account
Go to github.com and click Sign up. Pick a username (e.g. mahe-codific), enter your email and a password, verify your account, and you're in. The free plan is all you need.

Step 2 — Create a new repository
Once logged in:

Click the + button (top-right) → New repository
Name it something like wc2026-predictions
Make sure it's set to Public (required for free GitHub Pages)
Leave everything else as default
Click Create repository
You'll land on an empty repo page.

Step 3 — Upload your files
Click Add file → Upload files
Open your outputs folder at: C:\Users\mahep\AppData\Roaming\Claude\local-agent-mode-sessions\...\outputs\github_repo\
Select and drag all these files into the GitHub upload area:
index.html
match_data.py
fit_improved.py
sim_improved.py
bracket_predictor.py
build_html.py
fetch_matches.py
requirements.txt
model_params.json
wc2026_v2_results.json
bracket_data.json
Scroll down, leave the commit message as-is, click Commit changes
The .github/workflows/update.yml file is trickier — you can't drag a folder. Do this separately:

Click Add file → Create new file
In the filename box type exactly: .github/workflows/update.yml (GitHub will auto-create the folders)
Open the file github_repo\.github\workflows\update.yml in Notepad, copy the contents, and paste them in
Click Commit changes
Step 4 — Enable GitHub Pages
In your repo, click Settings (top tab bar)
In the left sidebar, click Pages
Under "Source", select Deploy from a branch
Set Branch to main, folder to / (root)
Click Save
After about 60 seconds, you'll see a green box with your URL: https://[your-username].github.io/wc2026-predictions/

That's your live site. Share it with anyone.

Step 5 — Get a free football-data.org API key
Go to football-data.org/client/register
Sign up with your email — takes 30 seconds
They'll email you a key like abc123def456...
This is what lets the auto-updater pull in World Cup match results once the tournament starts on June 11.

Step 6 — Add the API key to GitHub (secret)
Back in your GitHub repo:

Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions
Click New repository secret
Name: FD_API_KEY
Value: paste your key from football-data.org
Click Add secret
GitHub stores this encrypted — it's never visible again after you save it.

Step 7 — Test the full pipeline manually
In your repo, click the Actions tab
You'll see Update WC 2026 Predictions in the left list
Click it, then click Run workflow → Run workflow (green button)
Watch it run — it takes about 35 seconds. When it finishes with a green tick, your site has been updated. The page will now show "Last updated: [today's date]" in the header.

What happens automatically after this
Every day at 6am UTC, GitHub will run the pipeline for free. Once the World Cup kicks off on June 11, it'll pull the previous day's results, retrain the model on the new data, rerun 75,000 simulations, and push a fresh index.html — all without you doing anything. Each commit will show up in the repo history so you can see exactly when and what changed.

The one thing to be aware of: once group stage games are actually being played, the model will start updating probabilities for the remaining matches based on real results, but it won't "lock in" completed results in the bracket view — it'll still show predicted scores for finished games rather than actual scores. That's a further improvement we could make closer to tournament time if you want.

You said: is there already something like this?
is there already something like this?

Claude responded: Yes, a few — it's worth knowing the landscape:

Thought process

Yes, a few — it's worth knowing the landscape:

FiveThirtyEight was the gold standard. They ran Soccer Power Index (SPI) ratings and simulated every major tournament with ~100k+ simulations, Dixon-Coles style. Their site updated daily. It was probably the best free public model. Unfortunately they shut down in 2023, so their 2026 predictions won't happen.

Nielsen Gracenote (sports data company) publishes WC simulations and gets cited by the BBC, ESPN, etc. They use a proprietary Elo variant. Results are published but the methodology isn't open.

Goldman Sachs / UBS / Deutsche Bank all publish one-off WC prediction papers using machine learning models as a marketing exercise. Published once before the tournament, never updated.

Club Elo (clubelo.com) and eloratings.net maintain live Elo ratings for national teams but don't run simulations — just the raw ratings.

Betting markets (Betfair, Pinnacle) are arguably the most accurate single source since they aggregate thousands of informed people. Spain are currently around 5–6/1 on most books, implying ~15–17%, which is interestingly lower than our 22%.

What we have that's different: The combination of Dixon-Coles (not just Elo), L2 regularisation, squad values, host advantage, and the auto-updating GitHub Pages setup is more sophisticated than most public free tools — and with FiveThirtyEight gone there's genuinely nothing comparable that's open and live right now. The main honest gap versus the professionals is data quality: Gracenote and Opta ingest every international match automatically across all confederations; our training data was assembled manually.

If you wanted to close that gap, replacing fetch_matches.py with a proper Opta or Stats Perform data feed (both have paid APIs) would make the model genuinely competitive with anything publicly available.

You said: is it worth it?
is it worth it?

Claude responded: Depends what "worth it" means to you.
Depends what "worth it" means to you.

If it's for personal interest / fun — yes, absolutely. You've already built something more rigorous than most public WC predictors, and watching it update in real time as the tournament unfolds is genuinely interesting. Seeing Spain's odds shift after a surprise result in Group H, or Norway's probability collapse if they lose to France, is satisfying in a way static predictions aren't.

If it's for betting — probably not on its own. Betting markets are efficient and already price in most of what our model knows. Our 22% for Spain vs ~16% implied by bookmakers odds is a meaningful disagreement, but you'd need to be confident the model is right and the market is wrong to act on it — and historically markets beat models on individual matches.

If it's for credibility / showing people — yes. With FiveThirtyEight gone there's a real gap. A clean, live, well-reasoned WC prediction page that you can share gets genuine traction. If you posted it on LinkedIn or Twitter as the tournament starts, it would likely get a real audience.

The honest cost-benefit of the GitHub setup specifically: It takes maybe 30 minutes to set up, then zero ongoing effort. The model runs itself. The main real risk is a bug surfaces when live tournament data starts flowing in June and nobody's watching. That said, the worst that happens is the pipeline fails silently and the page just stops updating — it doesn't break or go offline.

My actual take: the model is already done and the GitHub setup is a relatively small extra step to make it accessible and persistent rather than just sitting in a local folder. Given you've invested this much, it's worth the 30 minutes.

Good, all 12 files are ready. Here's exactly what to do:

Uploading the files — two parts

Part A: The main files (drag and drop)

Click "uploading an existing file" on the GitHub page (you can see it in your screenshot)
Open this folder in Windows Explorer:
   C:\Users\mahep\AppData\Roaming\Claude\local-agent-mode-sessions\1c7f564c-4492-4a27-adef-a0db8ec35bef\f7342b92-f42f-4115-acd7-0d4183943c90\local_a30f10eb-cb0b-4414-9e10-e2b4de83337a\outputs\github_repo
Select these 9 files (don't select the .github folder yet — GitHub's file uploader can't handle folders):
fit_improved.py
sim_improved.py
bracket_predictor.py
match_data.py
fetch_matches.py (wait — this file won't exist yet, skip it)
build_html.py
requirements.txt
model_params.json
wc2026_v2_results.json
bracket_data.json
index.html
Drag them all onto the GitHub upload area, then scroll down and click "Commit changes"
Part B: The workflow file (must be done separately)

GitHub needs the workflow in a specific folder path. After committing Part A:

Click "Add file" → "Create new file"
In the filename box at the top, type exactly: .github/workflows/update.yml (GitHub will automatically create the nested folders as you type the slashes)
In the big text area below, paste this:
yaml

        run: python bracket_predictor.py

      - name: Build index.html
        run: python build_html.py

      - name: Commit and push updated files
        run: |
          git config --local user.email "github-actions[bot]@users.noreply.github.com"

          git add index.html model_params.json wc2026_v2_results.json bracket_data.json fetched_matches.json
          git diff --staged --quiet || git commit -m "Auto-update predictions: $(date +'%Y-%m-%d')"
          git push
Click "Commit new file"
Let me know once both commits are done and I'll walk you through enabling GitHub Pages (one click) so the site goes live.

Node.js 20 actions are deprecated. The following actions are running on Node.js 20 and may not work as expected: actions/checkout@v4, actions/setup-python@v5. Actions will be forced to run with Node.js 24 by default starting June 2nd, 2026. Node.js 20 will be removed from the runner on September 16th, 2026. Please check if updated versions of these actions are available that support Node.js 24. To opt into Node.js 24 now, set the FORCE_JAVASCRIPT_ACTIONS_TO_NODE24=true environment variable on the runner or in your workflow file. Once Node.js 24 becomes the default, you can temporarily opt out by setting ACTIONS_ALLOW_USE_UNSECURE_NODE_VERSION=true.

Claude responded: The Node.

The Node.js warning is harmless — that's not the failure. The real error is hiding in one of the Python steps above that. To find it:

On the GitHub Actions run page, look for the step with a red ✗ next to it
Click to expand that step — the actual Python error/traceback will be there
Share that text with me and I'll fix it
While you're doing that, let me also fix the Node.js deprecation warning so it stops cluttering the logs:


Read a file, edited a file
Read a file, edited a file
On GitHub, go to your workflow file and edit it to add those 3 lines (env: +   FORCE_JAVASCRIPT_ACTIONS_TO_NODE24: true + blank line) right before jobs: — or once you find the actual Python error, I can fix both in one go.

What's most likely failing: either fit_improved.py can't find/import match_data.py, or build_html.py can't find one of the JSON files. Share the red step's output and I'll know exactly what to patch.

Claude responded: Simple fix — fetch_matches.

Thought process
Thought process
Simple fix — fetch_matches.py wasn't uploaded to the repo. You need to add it.

On GitHub:

Click "Add file" → "Upload files"
Navigate to your github_repo folder and upload fetch_matches.py
Commit it
Then go back to Actions → Update WC 2026 Predictions → "Re-run all jobs" to try again.

While you're at it, double-check that all these files are showing in your repo's file list (the main code page):

fit_improved.py
sim_improved.py
bracket_predictor.py
match_data.py
fetch_matches.py ← missing this one for sure
build_html.py
requirements.txt
model_params.json
wc2026_v2_results.json
bracket_data.json
index.html
If any others are missing too, upload them all in one batch now so you don't hit this again on the next step.

Claude responded: The file isn't reaching the repo root.

The file isn't reaching the repo root. Let's verify — can you go to github.com/r3dalchem1st/wc2026-predictions and tell me exactly what files you see listed there? (Or take a screenshot.)

The most common reason this happens is the file got uploaded into a subfolder instead of the root. GitHub's drag-and-drop uploader puts files wherever you drop them, so if the folder itself was dragged, the file ends up nested.

Also check: after uploading, did you see a green "Commit changes" button and click it? If you navigated away before committing, the upload was discarded.

Claude responded: I can see the problem — Windows truncated all your filenames to the old 8.

Thought process
Thought process
I can see the problem — Windows truncated all your filenames to the old 8.3 format (FETCH_~1.PY instead of fetch_matches.py) because the folder path is too long. Python can't find fetch_matches.py because it literally doesn't exist by that name.

Fix: copy the files to a shorter path first.

Let me create a zip you can extract somewhere short like C:\wc2026\:


Ran 2 commands, loaded tools
Ran 2 commands, loaded tools
Here's the zip: Download wc2026_upload.zip

Steps:

Extract the zip to a short path like C:\wc2026\ (right-click → Extract All → type C:\wc2026)
On GitHub, delete all the broken files — click each BRACKE~1.PY etc., open it, click the trash icon, commit. Or you can select them all if GitHub lets you do bulk delete.
Re-upload from C:\wc2026\ — Add file → Upload files → drag all 11 files from C:\wc2026\ into the upload area → Commit
The .github/workflows/update.yml file should already be fine since it went in separately. Once the 11 files are committed with proper names, re-run the workflow and it should work.

Now go to GitHub and fix it directly in the browser — no need to re-upload:

Click on fit_improved.py in your repo

Change pri to print("Saved: model_params.json")

Then re-run the workflow. The fit step will pass — you can see it was actually working perfectly (Elo, Dixon-Coles, everything converged) before hitting that one stray word.

You said: how can i edit the page?
how can i edit the page? or install themes?

Claude responded: Since your site is generated automatically by build_html.

Thought process
Thought process
Since your site is generated automatically by build_html.py, you have two paths:

The right way: edit build_html.py Any changes you make directly to index.html on GitHub will get overwritten the next time the workflow runs. So visual changes need to go into build_html.py, which generates the HTML. That's where the CSS, colors, fonts, and layout all live. I can restyle it for you — just tell me what you want.

GitHub Pages "themes" won't work here Those themes are for Jekyll sites (markdown-based blogs). Your site is plain HTML, so the theme picker in Settings has no effect on it.

What kind of changes are you thinking? For example:

Different color scheme / dark mode tweaks
Different fonts
Bigger/smaller cards or tables
A different layout for the bracket
Add your name / branding
Make it look more like a proper sports analytics site (ESPN/FiveThirtyEight style)
Tell me what you're after and I'll update build_html.py so the next workflow run produces the new look automatically.

Now edit the workflow file directly on GitHub:

Click .github/workflows → update.yml → pencil icon
Find the runs-on: ubuntu-latest line and add permissions: contents: write right after it, so it looks like this:

    permissions:

Commit the change, then re-run the workflow
That's all it needs — GitHub now requires you to explicitly grant write permission to the Actions bot rather than giving it by default.

Not really for a site like this — Elementor is for WordPress, and Figma is a design mockup tool (the output is an image, not a live website). Neither connects directly to a GitHub Pages static site.

Your practical options are:

1. Tell me what you want — I'll write it This is the fastest path. Describe what you're after ("make it look like ESPN", "dark theme with green accents", "bigger flags, cleaner tables") and I'll redesign build_html.py. You'd see the result on your live site after the next workflow run.

2. I show you a preview first I can render the current page here and mock up style changes so you can react to them before I touch any code.

3. Figma → I code it You have Figma connected — you could sketch a rough layout there, share the link, and I'd translate it into HTML/CSS in build_html.py. More work for you upfront but gives you full visual control.

Honestly the quickest win: tell me a site or app whose look you like (ESPN, FiveThirtyEight, a dark sports dashboard, anything) and I'll use that as a reference. What vibe are you going for?

You said: okay i'll probably try the figma route, though im curious about how the espn style would look ,could you make a picture?

My vote is xSPN — the lowercase x is a direct nod to xG (expected goals), which is exactly the kind of analytical tool this is. It's also visually distinct and would look great as a logo mark.

For the font, Barlow feels most natural for sports — it has a slight athletic compactness without being aggressive. Inter is the safe professional choice. Click one to send me straight to the redesign.

Barlow font from Google Fonts
Light theme — white cards, red accents, dark nav bar
W/D/L/Pts standings in each group card (top 2 highlighted in red = qualified)
"Spain Spain" duplicate fixed in the All Matches tab
fit_improved.py pri typo fixed

For each file on GitHub: open it → pencil icon → select all → paste → commit. The workflow file lives at .github/workflows/update.yml so navigate into that folder first. Once all three are updated, hit Actions → Re-run all jobs and it should go all the way through.

A few things to check quickly:

Did the workflow re-run? Go to Actions — if it's still showing the old run, trigger a new one manually (Run workflow button)
Hard refresh the page — Ctrl+Shift+R (bypasses browser cache)
GitHub Pages cache — can take 2–5 minutes to update even after a successful workflow run
If you don't want to wait for the workflow, I can generate the new index.html directly right now and you can upload it straight to GitHub — that'll update the page immediately without running any scripts:


Read 4 files, ran 3 commands
Read 4 files, ran 3 commands
The file got truncated — the closing ''' and everything after the podium section is missing. I need to rewrite the full file cleanly:


Ran a command, read a file
Ran a command, read a file
Good — the data section is intact. Now I'll write the complete file from scratch with everything correct:


Created a file, ran a command
Created a file, ran a command
The triple single-quote ''' delimiter is clashing with something in the CSS. Let me switch to triple double-quotes which are safer here:


Ran 3 commands
Ran 3 commands
The Write tool keeps truncating the file mid-content. I'll solve this properly by splitting it into a short build_html.py + a template.html — no more f-string escaping nightmares:


Created a file
Created a file
Now the template — plain HTML, no Python escaping, single { and } everywhere:


Created a file, ran a command
Created a file, ran a command
Works. Now let me package the updated files:


Ran a command
Ran a command
Download xspn_updates2.zip

Five files inside. Upload all of them to GitHub (Add file → Upload files), then commit. The index.html in there is already the finished xSPN-styled page — so the redesign will be live the moment GitHub Pages picks it up, even before the workflow runs.

You said: can i not just edit the existing eith this text?

Claude responded: Yes, exactly — for each file on GitHub:

Yes, exactly — for each file on GitHub:

Click the file name
Click the pencil icon (top right of the file view)
Select all the existing text (Ctrl+A)
Paste the new content
Click Commit changes
The files to update and where to get the content:

build_html.py — view it here
template.html — this is a new file, so use Add file → Create new file, name it template.html, paste the content from here
fit_improved.py — view it here
.github/workflows/update.yml — view it here
Once those four are committed, run the workflow and index.html will also update automatically. Or you can upload the pre-built index.html directly too for an instant preview.
